# Numerical approaches for Boussinesq type equations with its application in Kampar River, Indonesia

## About
This is the resource code for paper [Numerical approaches for Boussinesq type equations with its application in Kampar River, Indonesia.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2023.05.002) Created by I. Magdalena, D.N. Haloho, and M.B. Adityawan.

We use Matlab2021a to implement our algorithm.

## Introduction
In this study, we examine numerous numerical approaches for solving the 1-Dimensional Boussinesq problem. The proposed methods to be discussed include three algorithms: Mohapatra and Chaudhryâ€™s two-four finite difference scheme, the modified two-four finite difference scheme, and the staggered finite volume scheme. 
The numerical schemes were then used to simulate dam-break flow over wet and dry beds. The simulation results will be systematically compared and used to assess the contribution of each individual Boussinesq term. Each Boussinesq term was evaluated to determine its impact on the calculated result of the Boussinesq equation. Further, the numerical scheme will be applied to simulate the tidal bore phenomenon in the Kampar River in order to estimate the intensity and size of the tidal bore, which will then be compared to the actual data.
